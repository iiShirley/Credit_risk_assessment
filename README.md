# Comprehensive Credit Risk Assessment Using Loan Application Data

## Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of **credit risk** using detailed loan data from the **U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)**.  
The dataset includes information on loan approval dates, terms, and amounts, along with business demographics such as industry, size, and location.

By combining loan-level data with geographic and demographic information across U.S. states, this study aims to uncover **regional and economic factors** affecting loan performance, approval decisions, and default rates.  
Our ultimate goal is to help financial institutions improve lending strategies by identifying patterns that promote **fair, effective, and risk-minimized lending practices**.

## Research Questions
1. **How does loan performance vary across different states, and which states have the highest default rates?**  
2. **What are the key factors that influence the approval or denial of a loan?**  
3. **How many loans were given to each industry sector, and how does loan distribution differ by business type or location?**

---

## Motivation
Our motivation stems from our shared background in **business analytics** and our understanding of the importance of **data-driven decision-making**.  
Through this project, we aim to apply analytical and statistical techniques to real-world financial data to explore credit risk factors that can improve **loan evaluation and economic growth**.
